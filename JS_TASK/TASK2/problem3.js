// What is the output of this program and why? Write the proper reason below the
// program.
var y;
console.log(y === "cool");

// The output is false because when we declare a variable but don't assigned any value to it then it's value is by default is Undefined. So in console.log we compare undefined and string which are both different data types so the result it gives false.
