            <p>The contribution of Muslims to the conception, growth and development of Chemistry is unforgettable. It
                is as immense as in other branches of science. Chemistry is one of the great parts of science study in
                which Muslims have made <em> significant contributions</em> and they developed it to a <em> high degree
                    of perfection</em>. For their contributions, they are considered supreme authorities in this branch
                of science.</p>

            <p> <strong> Jabir Ibn Hayyan</strong> was born in around 702 AD. He is known as the <span
                    class="bg-yellow"> father of modern Chemistry</span> along with <strong> Zakariya Razi</strong>, who
                is one of the greatest scientists in Chemistry. He was engaged in making gold by mixing different
                substances. He discovered many important substances such as <em> Sulphuric Acid
                    <b>(H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>)</b>, Hydrochloric Acid <b> (HCl)</b>, Nitric Acid
                    <b>(HN0<sub>3</sub>)</b> etc</em>. The Muslims introduced experiments in the whole scientific method
                which was previously done by just theories not <del>practical implementation</del>. </p>

            <p> <strong>Abu Rayhan Al-Bayruni</strong> and <strong>Ibn Khaldun</strong> refuted the theory of the
                conversion of metals. They were not only the pioneers of Chemistry during mediaeval times, but also they
                are considered to be authoritative figures in the modern age of Chemistry. The modern <br>

                    would never have arisen at all; it is <br> absolutely certain that but for them, it would not have
                    <br> assumed that character which has enabled it to <br> transcend all previous phases of
                    evolution."</div><br>
                Chemistry owes a great deal to the genius of these Muslim luminaries. Muslims of today should strive to
                make contributions in different disciplines of knowledge and science like the Muslim scholars in the
                past and bring glory to their own country as well.<br><span class="Auther"> __By Robert Briffault from
